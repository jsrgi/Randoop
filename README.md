# Randoop


Randoop generates unit tests using feedback-directed random test generation. 
This technique randomly, but smartly, generates sequences of method/constructor invocations for the classes under test. 
Randoop executes the sequences it creates, using the results of the execution to create assertions that capture the behavior or your program. 
Randoop creates tests from the code sequences and assertions.
